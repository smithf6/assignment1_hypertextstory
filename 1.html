    <h2>Summer Jobs</h2>
    <p>
       Above is a picture of Zack. We both got summer jobs dishwashing and prep<br>
        cooking after our freshmen year. Shortly after we began to work in the kitchen<br>
         part time while going to school, and cook during dinner services. For a few years<br>
          we were roomates and I would often hitch a ride to work with him. However since<br>
           he has moved to Bellvue I've been biking.<br>
           <br>
    
    I've always been a big bicyclist, which is especially convienent for getting<br>
    from campus to work. Several months ago I got a <a href="2.html">E-bike</a> which<br>
    has been very useful and a lot of fun.
