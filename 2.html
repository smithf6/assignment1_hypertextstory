        Sometimes before work I will stop at the benches overlooking the bay by<br>
        Boulevard Park. Here I like to get in a bit of studying or reading.<br>
        <br>

        I've found this to be a relaxing spot to prepare for a possible <a href="3.html">tense service</a><br>
        at the restaraunt.
