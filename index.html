    <h2>Cooking at the Black Cat</h2>
    <p>
    An interesting thing about myself that I can share is what I do for work.<br>
    When im not at school or at home im usually in Fairhaven at The Black Cat,<br>
    which is a retaraunt on the third floor of the old hotel building there.<br>
    Working in the kitchen can be hectic and stressful sometimes but it helps<br>
    to have good team members you can depend on.<br>
    <br>
   One of those people was my friend from school <a href="1.html">Zack</a> who I<br>
   met my first year here at Western.
